# How to run the code

Download the whole respiratory

In the media_2.py, change the model path so that it suits ur current local path

Run it locally

And Mediapipe only works on Python 3.10 so if you are having Python 3.14 then uninstall it and install Python 3.10

Google Colab can not open the webcam using OpenCV so the code must be run locally.

# Requirements:
python 3.10: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/

Libraries: pip install 

opencv-python
